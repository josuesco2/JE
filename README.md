This is a basic program that pretty prints all
available ports on /etc/services

- NOTE THIS IS AN EXERCISE TO LEARNING PYTHON AND LINUX 
  
- IN ORDER TO RUN YOU NEED TO:
     - RUN IT ON LINUX BOX
     - HAVE THE prettytable python module install


-TODO:
   - configure the script to interact and allow port/name queries
